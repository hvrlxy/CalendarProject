CAL(1)                         MCS-284 Commands Manual                     CAL(1)

NAME
     cal - displays a calendar

SYNOPSIS
     cal [[month] year]
     cal -m month [year]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format.

     The options are as follows:

     -m month
             Display the specified month.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1753-9999) to be displayed; note the
     year must be fully specified: "cal 89" will not display a calendar for 1989.
     Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either a number
     between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by the current
     locale.  Month and year default to those of the current system clock and
     time zone (so "cal -m 8" will display a calendar for the month of August in
     the current year). Month can be written as both numeric value or scripting
     value. If you want to call a month by how they are written in English, you only
     need to make sure that the first three charaters are correct (January is written
     as jan). The function is not case sensitive.

     A year starts on January 1.

HISTORY
     A cal command appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX and later in BSD UNIX.
     The output of the cal command is supposed to be bit for bit compatible to
     the original Unix cal command, because its output is processed by other
     programs like CGI scripts, that should not be broken. Therefore it will
     always output 8 lines, even if only 7 contain data. This extra blank
     line also appears with the original cal command, at least on Solaris 8

BUGS
     This program can only perform a subset of the BSD cal program.
